### 👨‍💻 Software Engineer | Backend & Security programmer 🚀

Hello friend. I'm a software engineer with a knack for crafting robust backends. My heart currently beats in TypeScript, and I'm all about building scalable and maintainable systems. Here's a glimpse of my multilingual prowess:

1. **Typescript** 🌐
2. **Java** ☕
3. **Python** 🐍
4. **PHP** 🐘
5. **Ruby** 💎
6. **C++** 🚀 (Newbie!)

🔒 For the past 5 years, I've been diving deep into the security sector, contributing my skills to a video management service and an access control engine.

Feel free to explore my repositories, and let's connect for some coding adventures! 🚀👩‍💻
